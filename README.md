A comprehensive, 215-page project dedicated to the application of advanced prompt engineering techniques for structuring and synthesizing vast amounts of complex data. Developed and iterated precise instructional prompts to reliably extract, analyze, and refine information from Large Language Models (LLMs). This experience demonstrates my proficiency in human-AI interaction design, critical evaluation of AI outputs, and extensive technical documentation management. This project is the sole proof of my Prompt engineering techniques and research skills.

In this project, the case subject I have chosen is #BLACK HOLE Data syntehesis.
